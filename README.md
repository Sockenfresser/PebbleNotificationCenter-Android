## Building

To build this project properly, you will also need [PebbleAndroidCommons](https://github.com/matejdro/PebbleAndroidCommons) directory next to PebbleNotificationCenter one. Then you just open PebbleNotificationCenter directory with Android Studio and it should automatically resolve all dependencies.
